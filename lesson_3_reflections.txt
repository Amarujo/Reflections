When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all in your work local?
There are some cases where a remote repository can really help, like shared projects and working with different machines..

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because as the same way you push the final version of your final to a remote it would be fair to pull the version that has been commited
